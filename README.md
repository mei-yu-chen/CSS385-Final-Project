Elevator Pitch:
Do you enjoy games like Mario where timing and control matter, you’ll love this! My game is a fun and simple 2D platform jumping game. The goal is to move, jump, and collect items across platforms while testing your precision and rhythm. It’s easy to learn but challenging to master, let's play it!

Game Synopsis:
Control your character to explore platforms and collect items by moving. Carefully navigate an open-ended environment, avoiding traps and advancing without a set finish line. Unleash your curiosity by exploring the unknown!

Objective:
The main goal of the game is to collect all the items scattered across the map.

Mechanics:
Use the arrow keys to move left and right, and press the spacebar to jump to higher platforms. Walk over collectible items and pick them up, which will earn the points. Future updates: Add enemies, traps, and moving platforms to make the game more challenging.
